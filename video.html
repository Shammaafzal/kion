                <p class="text">THE VIDEO IS ALL ABOUT THE LESSONS I HAVE LEARNED FROM AMMA IN AMRITA VISHWAVIDYAPEETHAM. Mata Amritanandamayi was born in a remote coastal village in Kerala, South India in 1953.Even as a small child, it was clear that She was unique.
                    At six months She could walk and talk, and by the age of three, She was constantly singing. By the age of five, She was composing beautiful, extraordinarily profound hymns to Her beloved Krishna.<br> Amma had no feelings of strangeness
                    when She came into this world. Everything was so utterly familiar to Her, and when one knows everything about the world one can only smile. When one beholds the entire universe as a play of Consciousness, what else can one do but smile?
                    —Amma As part of Her work, She had to collect food for the family cows. She would roam the local villages, gathering grass and visiting neighbourhood homes to ask for vegetable peels and leftover rice gruel for the cows. At times like
                    these, She saw many things that troubled Her. She saw how some people were starving, while others had more than enough. She saw that many people were sick and suffering from intense pain, unable to afford a single painkiller. And She
                    noticed that many of the elderly were neglected and treated harshly by their own families. Her empathy was such that the pain of others was unbearable to Her. Though just a child, She began to contemplate the question of suffering.
                    She asked Herself, why do people suffer? What is the underlying cause of suffering? And so powerfully did She feel the presence of God within Her that She wanted to reach out and comfort and uplift those who were less fortunate than
                    She. In the book The Timeless Path, Swami Ramakrishnananda Puri, one of Amṛtānandamayī's senior disciples, wrote: "The [spiritual] path inculcated by Amma is the same as the one presented in the Vedas and recapitulated in subsequent
                    traditional scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita."[18] Amṛtānandamayī herself says, "karma [action], jñana [knowledge] and bhakti [devotion] are all essential. If the two wings of a bird are devotion and action, knowledge is its tail.
                    Only with the help of all three can the bird soar into the heights."[19] She accepts the various spiritual practices and prayers of all religions as but different methods toward the same goal of purifying the mind.[20] Along these
                    lines, she stresses the importance of meditation, performing actions as karma yoga, selfless service, and cultivating divine qualities such as compassion, patience, forgiveness, self-control, etc. Amṛtānandamayī has said that these
                    practices refine the mind, preparing it to assimilate the ultimate truth: that one is not the physical body and mind, but the eternal, blissful consciousness that serves as the non-dual substratum of the universe.[18] This understanding
                    itself Amṛtānandamayī referred to as jivanmukti [liberation while alive]. Amṛtānandamayī said, "Jivanmukti is not something to be attained after death, nor is it to be experienced or bestowed upon you in another world. It is a state
                    of perfect awareness and equanimity, which can be experienced here and now in this world, while living in the body. Having come to experience the highest truth of oneness with the Self, such blessed souls do not have to be born again
